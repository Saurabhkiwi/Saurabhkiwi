🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a dedicated and curious engineering student who loves building real-world systems and solving challenging technical problems.
My work spans Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Backend Development, Operating Systems, and Databases.

I enjoy working on impactful AI projects — from small & dim target detection, to helmet detection for traffic safety, to event safety monitoring systems, and more.

🔥 What I Do
🧠 Machine Learning & Deep Learning

CNN models for small & dim target detection in IR images

Helmet detection + number plate extraction using YOLO + OCR

Time-series + tabular predictions (crop price, yield, ROI forecasting)

Model optimisation, dataset preparation & augmentation

Strong understanding of ML fundamentals (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

🧾 Backend & Systems

Java (including Java 21), SQL, PL/SQL

Spring Boot applications

REST APIs for ML integration

OS concepts: Scheduling, Semaphores, Synchronisation

Network & subnetting tasks

🗄️ Databases

PostgreSQL, Oracle

Stored procedures (PL/SQL)

Triggers, transactions, query optimisation

Materialized views, normalization, functional dependency analysis

💡Projects I've worked on: 

🛰️ Small & Dim Target Detection System (CNN-based)

🚦 Real-time Helmet Violation Detection with Report Generation

🌾 Crop Yield & Market Price Prediction using ML

🤖 AgriConnect – Model accuracy improvement & dataset enhancement
